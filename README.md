Product Enrichment API
This project is a Spring Boot REST API that simulates an AI-powered product enrichment service.
It receives basic product data via a POST request and returns a detailed product description, along with the original product information.

Features
POST /products â€“ Accepts a product name and features, then generates a description.

Stores enriched products in-memory for quick retrieval.

Demonstrates clean architecture with Controller, Service, and DTO layers.

AI functionality is mocked to simulate the generation process without external API calls.
